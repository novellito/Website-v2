7. Bio: I am a junior CS student with an avid interest in full stack development. Eveything I know related to web development is 
self taught and I have dedicated countless hours to learning new technologies. A recent accomplishment would be winning 2nd place at the Accessibilities 
competition here at CSUN as well as making the Dean's List for the third year in a row. 

Best piece of IT advice
    Don't try to change or modify something that is already working unless you really know what you're doing.

My 3 tech support advices
    1. If  it's not working, trying restarting it and if restarting didn't solve the issue then you should try to Google (stackoverflow) it.
    2. Probably any technical issue you will run into has also been experienced by someone else, so you are only a couple Google searches away 
    from finding the solution to your problem.
    3. Be on top of the latest tech trends, because it is possible that the issues you could have been having may have been fixed with an update.
    4. Just because I'm a CS major doesn't mean I can fix your computer.

Best Advice at an internship
    I personally have not had an internship experience but the best work related advice I've had is to be respectful of other people's opinions 
    regardless of whether you agree with it or not. 

Any other advice on technology?
   Don't fall into the trap of buying something every year just for that one small upgrade, because technology will always be evolving to the point that
   you'll run out of money if you keep trying to keep up with the latest products.
